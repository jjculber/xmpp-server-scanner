This bot fetchs information about Jabber/XMPP servers and generates html and xml files with the features of those servers. Optionally, you can also dump the information to a database.

The information obtained is
  * The services provided (MUC, tansports...)
  * The server version
  * The server uptime
  * How many times the server was offline

You can see it working at http://www.jabberes.org/servers/ http://www.jaim.at/server/ (and the coccinella  branch at ~~http://coccinella.im/servers/servers.html~~)

I started this project because it seemed neccesary to update the old servers and services list on the jabber.org website and I wanted to write some code related with Jabber/XMPP. It isn't a serious project, but an project to experiment and learn. But it works, (al least it seems to work ;) ) and some people like it.

**Note: this project hasn't been updated since 2011 and is not maintained**
